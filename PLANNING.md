## Project Summary

Learning Pigs is a flashcard app that can be used to teach and encourage speech for a toddler. This app will present a card with a picture and text prompt to encourage a child to vocalize what that card represents. Cards can be marked right or wrong by the parent to track progress each session.

## Problem Statement

Current learning tools for toddlers do not allow for enough customization to target my daughter's specific needs.

## User Stories

- A user can see a single card, randomly picked from a category.
- User sees both a picture and text prompt on the card.
- A user can mark each card as successful or unsuccessful.
- A user is able to see a summary of performance (number of correct and incorrect cards) each session.
- User can click a "next card" button to display the next flash card.
