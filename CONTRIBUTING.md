# Contributing

We ♥ contributors! By participating in this project, you agree to abide by the [code of conduct](https://github.com/saramccombs/words-with-piggie/blob/master/CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md).

**First:** if you're unsure or afraid of *anything*, just ask or submit the issue or pull request anyways. You won't be yelled at for giving your best effort. The worst that can happen is that you'll be politely asked to change something. We appreciate any sort of contributions, and don't want a wall of rules to get in the way of that.

## Pull Request Process

Here are the basic steps to submit a pull request. Make sure that you're working
on an [open issue]–if the relevant issue doesn't exist, open it!

[open issue]: https://github.com/saramccombs/words-with-piggie/issues

1. Claim an issue on [our issue tracker][open issue] by assigning it to yourself
   (if you are a core team member) or commenting to the issue with your name and something along the lines of "I'm working on this". If the issue doesn't exist yet, open it.

2. Fork the repo.

3. Clone the repo into your IDE.

4. Make whatever changed required by the issue that you are resolvoing/addressing.

5. Push to your fork and submit a pull request in this repo. Include the issue number
   (ex. `Resolves #1`) in the PR description. 
   
*NOTE:* The PR request is formatted to require certain information. Please fill out as much as reasonable. 

At this point you're waiting on us–we'll try to respond to your PR quickly.
We may suggest some changes or improvements or alternatives.
